1) Edit the file you want to change, it wont record unless you use 'add', if you edit again it will keep the added version and the newest.
2) Run 'git add filename' to include the latest edit you made.
3) Run 'git commit -m "Describe what you did"'. Commit is like taking a snapshot of the file. You can return to a previous commit if you want.
3) Run 'git pull -u origin master' to upload it on github repository
